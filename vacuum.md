## About the vacuum system


Our vacuum target is 10<sup>-5</sup> torr, which we will achieve using a combination of mechanical and cryogenic pumps.
 We have two rotary vane pumps, one of which is currently out of service due to an oil leak which we are yet to fix. 
The operational pump has an advertised minimum operating pressure of 10<sup>-3</sup> torr as set by the vapor pressure of the oil. 
This number is optimistic, to say the least. Our vacuum
 manifold is designed such that the mechanical pumps can be isolated from the vacuum chamber once they have hit their 
minimum pressure, allowing our cryosorption pump to pull out much of the remaining gas. Cryosorption pumps 
(or just “sorption” pumps) are designed to be cooled down to very low temperatures (below 77K, the boiling point of 
liquid nitrogen) so that residual gas can condense on a high surface area material in their interior. Our pump is 
filled with zeolite pellets, a high surface area ceramic. A photo of the sorption pump in its nitrogen bath is below:

## Design considerations


### Budget 

We designed our vacuum system on a stringent budget, so we are using primarily KF type flanges, the more 
affordable counterpart to CF flanges with copper gaskets. KF flanges use O-rings rather than costly single use
 copper gaskets, and can be interchanged readily. KF flanges, however, are leaky in comparison to 
the CF type and – although rated to 10<sup>-7</sup> torr – we are pushing the limits of their reasonable capability (and our
 sanity). *The Shed* is far from a cleanroom environment and we are constantly fighting entropy, trying to keep
 dust and debris off our o-rings and sealing surfaces.  

### Geometry

The performance of high and ultrahigh vacuum systems is somewhat dependent on their geometry. 
This is due to the extremely low gas densities encountered in the high and ultrahigh vacuum regimes;
 the mean free path is large enough that we are essentially dealing with billiard balls (gas molecules) rather than a continuous fluid. 
The relevant interactions of gas molecules become primarily those with the walls of the vacuum system. Thus, it is important to design the system so that it directs gas into the
 vacuum pump inlets. Ideally, we would have the chamber directly open to the inlet of a cryosorption pump or a 
turbomolecular pump (a very nice but *extremely* expensive form of vacuum pump) so that there is a direct path
 from the median plane (where we don’t want any gas) to the pump (where we trap or expel the gas). We have two 
large magnets and a host of other equipment in this area, however, so we must cope with a slightly longer escape 
path for trapped gasses.

## Vacuum issues and setbacks

Although we have reached vacuums in the 10<sup>-3</sup> torr range, we have been unable to test the
system below that. We recently replaced a leaky bellows isolation valve (it had a cracked fold) with a
pneumatic O-ring sealed valve to eliminate that leak and reduce the gas load on the pumps.
In the span of time between the last cryogenic test and installing the new valve the uninsulated shed hit temperatures of -25˚C. Water vapor in the air condensed and froze onto 
every surface, coating 
the inside of
the vacuum system in a thin layer of ice. This introduced a lot of water into our otherwise clean vacuum system and contaminated the oil in our
mechanical pump. Subsequent tests show that the outgassing is so extreme we cannot pull the system
below 0.5 torr with the mechanical pump and 4.42 &#183; 10 <sup>-2</sup> torr  with the sorption pump. Thus, we need to
replace the vacuum pump oil and bake out the whole system. This is in progress.

The above photo shows some of the outgassing problem. As this data was collected, the vacuum pump oil was visibily bubling (far above its vapor pressure), indicating a large amount of disolved 
gass or emulsified water.
