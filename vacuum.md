## About the vacuum system


Our vacuum target is 10e-5 torr, which we are achieving using a combination of mechanical and cryogenic pumps.
 We have two rotary vane pumps, one of which is currently out of service due to an oil leak which we are yet to fix. 
The operational pump has a minimum operating pressure of 10e-3 torr as set by the vapor pressure of the oil. Our vacuum
 manifold is designed such that the mechanical pumps can be isolated from the vacuum chamber once they have hit their 
minimum pressure, allowing our cryosorption pump to pull out much of the remaining gas. Cryosorption pumps 
(or just “sorption” pumps) are designed to be cooled down to very low temperatures (below 77K or the boiling point of 
liquid nitrogen) so that residual gas can condense on a high surface area material in their interior. Our pump is 
filled with zeolite pellets, a high surface area ceramic. A photo of the sorption pump in its nitrogen bath is below:

## Design considerations


### Budget 

We designed our vacuum system on a stringent budget, so we are using primarily KF type flanges, the more 
affordable counterpart to CF flanges with copper gaskets. KF flanges use o-rings rather than costly single use
 copper gaskets, and can be interchanged readily. KF flanges, however, are quite leaky in comparison to 
the CF type and – although rated to 10e-7 torr – we are pushing the limits of their reasonable capability (and our
 sanity). *The Shed* is far from a cleanroom environment and we are constantly fighting entropy, trying to keep
 dust and debris off our o-rings and sealing surfaces.  

### Geometry

The performance of high and ultrahigh vacuum systems is somewhat dependent on their geometry. 
This is due to the extremely low gas densities encountered in the high and ultrahigh vacuum regimes;
 the mean free path is large enough that we are essentially we dealing with billiard balls (gas molecules) rather than a continuous fluid. 
The particles in 
the gas behave independently of one another, and so they begin to interact primarily with the walls of the 
vacuum system itself. Thus, it is important to design the system so that it geometrically directs gas into the
 vacuum pump inlets. Ideally, we would have the chamber directly open to the inlet of a cryosorption pump or a 
turbomolecular pump (a very nice but *extremely* expensive form of vacuum pump) so that there is a direct path
 from the median plane (where we don’t want any gas) to the pump (where we trap or expel the gas). We have two 
large magnets and a host of other equipment in this area, however, so we must cope with a slightly longer escape 
path for trapped gasses. We have, however, made a few geometrical considerations: 


1) The vacuum gauges are located as close to the beamline as possible so that we have an accurate reading of the
pressure at the median plane. 


2) The mechanical pump inlets are located near the gauges and can be isolated from the system. 
This allows for easy leak detection (the isolation valves have been a source of leaks for us) and for us to 
transition from mechanical pumping to cryopumping  – facilitating higher vacuum levels. 


Below is an image of the majority of the vacuum system (the mechanical pumps and many of the chamber flanges are excluded).

Moving from top to bottom we have the chamber; an isolation valve (not currently in the system due to leaks); the cross to which 
the sorption pump (large cylinder to the left), the capacitance manometer gauge, and the mechanical pump isolation valves are attached. 
At the very bottom of the frame the vent valve and the mechanical pump connection are visible. The vent valve is a small pinhole valve 
that allows us to slowly vent the chamber without shocking sensitive components. Not pictured are the ion gauge (which was introduced to
the system after this photo was taken) and the ion source (which we are still in the process of prototyping). 


The ion gauge is pictured below:
